The Rockets are good. They could be better. They're currently [19-10](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings), fourth in the Western Conference, and they're doing it without Fred VanVleet, who tore his ACL in the preseason and won't return. Amen Thompson has slid into the starting point guard spot, with rookie Reed Sheppard running the second unit. The results? A mixed bag. Houston needs someone who can handle the ball and space the floor. Preferably both.

Before we dive in, the elephant in the room. The Rockets are close to being over the first apron with [$1,255,588 in space](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/cap). For non-cap nerds, that means they can only [take back as much salary as they send out in a trade](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/2025/06/30/nba-free-agency-explaining-first-second-aprons/84421655007/). No financial flexibility whatsoever (they can't sign anyone to even a vet. min without shedding salary somehow). The Rockets don't have many tradable assets either. It's an uphill battle. Rafael Stone has made diamonds out of coal before, though. The Rockets aren't devoid of assets entirely. So, the article marches on.

Let's break down potential trade targets, tiered from pipe dreams to phone calls Rafael Stone should've been making yesterday.

### Tier 1: Pipe Dreams - A Cursory Phone Call to See if a GM is Asleep at the Wheel

>Make a call to see if organizations want to commit front-office malpractice, accept a polite refusal and move on OR say yes and figure everything else out later.

**Josh Giddey:** Giddey isn't getting traded. He's signed to a [4-year, $100 million contract](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/74113/josh-giddey) as a 23-year-old and is averaging [20.1/9.2/8.9](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630581/traditional) as the primary option for the Bulls. That type of player isn't getting traded unless the Chicago Bulls front office decides they don't like their jobs anymore.

Still, he's technically available, and the Rockets should do due diligence. An elite playmaker ([career 2.32 AST/TO](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630581)) who's gotten better every year, shooting a career-best 40.2% from three while playing 33.5 minutes per game at just 25% usage? Check and check. He's 6'7" and 216 lbs, allowing him to guard multiple positions and slot into Houston's switchable scheme. Check. That's 3/3 and exactly what the Rockets need.

What the Rockets want vs. what they can get are two separate things. The Rockets [are hardcapped over the first apron](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/cap), which means they need to send out MORE salary than they take back. Giddey makes \$25 million. Houston's biggest contract to move? Fred VanVleet at $25 million, out for the season with a torn ACL and holding a no-trade clause.

So Houston's pitch becomes, take our injured point guard who can veto the deal, give us your healthy 23-year-old. Enticing. To sweeten it, Stone would need to attach Tari Eason (currently leading the league in three-point percentage) and the 2027 Brooklyn first-rounder (via swap), likely lottery-bound given Brooklyn's current trajectory.

![Josh Giddey Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766964929841.png)

Even then, why does Chicago say yes? They're swapping a building block for an injured 32-year-old and future assets. And VanVleet still has to waive his no-trade clause to join a lottery team. If the Bulls want to return to basketball purgatory, I'll pick up the phone and make the trade myself. Until then, this is a thought exercise, not a realistic path forward.

**Darius Garland:** Darius Garland is a prototypical floor general who can shoot and Cleveland's second option behind Donovan Mitchell. He's [averaged](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4396907/darius-garland) 18.8 ppg and 6.7 apg on 38.7% from three over his career.

Adding Garland would smooth out the kinks in Houston's starting lineup. Amen Thompson becomes a defense-focused shooting guard, the same role where he finished fifth in DPOY voting. Josh Okogie becomes a defensive specialist off the bench who can space the floor. The starting five gets a true secondary playmaker behind Şengün. Amen gets back to doing what he does best, being a defensive menace.

Nothing is as simple as pen and paper GM'ing. In reality, Garland makes [\$39.4 million annually through 2028](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/31562/darius-garland). The Rockets are hardcapped over the first apron, meaning they need to send out more salary than they take back. Getting to $40+ million outgoing means packaging FVV and a quality rotation player (think Dorian Finney-Smith at \$12.7 million and Josh Okogie on a minimum salary, which introduces new problems for Houston since they'd need to take back additional players just to meet the [NBA minimum 14 players](https://www.spotrac.com/news/_/id/2487/the-nbas-vanishing-15th-roster-spot)). Cleveland has to eat older players' salaries in return for their second-best player. Stone would need to attach the Brooklyn first-rounder as trade bait to make this remotely appealing. That's a premium for a player who doesn't want to be there.

![Darius Garland Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766964778211.png)

[Grant Afseth](https://dallashoopsjournal.com/p/nba-rumors-notebook-dallas-mavericks-giannis-antetokounmpo-cleveland-cavaliers-utah-jazz-daniel-gafford-anthony-davis/) reported that Garland wants to run his own team again, not play second fiddle to Donovan Mitchell. Going from Cleveland's second option to Houston's third doesn't solve that.

Then there's defense. Over [four years](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629636/by-position?Season=2022-23), Garland has allowed 37% from three and gets scored on by all three position groupings. Houston's identity is elite switchable defense. Garland is 6'1" and gets hunted in the playoffs. Introducing that weakness into a starting lineup that doesn't have one? The Rockets rank [4th in offensive rating](https://dunksandthrees.com/ratings) already. Sacrificing defensive identity to climb higher isn't worth it.

### Tier 2: Gnashing Teeth - Gut the Team/Identity, Raise the Ceiling

>Upgrades at the cost of team depth. May be good closer to the trade deadline, but right now unnecessarily guts the team in the midst of seeding hunt in a brutal Western Conference. Check back in a few months.

**Collin Sexton:** Collin Sexton is a human microwave. Over his career, he's averaged [18.6 ppg with 3.7 apg on 47.1/38.8/84.1 splits](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4277811/collin-sexton). Great efficiency. Shame he can't defend, and he doesn't create for others. There's a reason he gets shipped from team to team despite the sterling counting stats.

Starting Sexton would destroy the defensive identity Houston has built. But as a bench scorer? That's different. Move Reed Sheppard into the starting lineup at point guard. Slide Amen Thompson to shooting guard, Okogie to the bench. Now Sexton comes off the bench providing the same scoring punch Sheppard gave the second unit. The floor spacing holds, the defense takes a hit but that's more manageable with bench units.

The issue is money and timeline. Sexton makes [\$17.7M](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/26974/collin-sexton) and becomes a free agent this summer. He's a rental unless Houston can convince him to re-sign. To match salary under hardcap restrictions, the Rockets would need to package [Dorian Finney-Smith (\$12.7M) and Clint Capela (\$6.7M)](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/trade-machine/_/year/2025/team1/cha/team2/hou). That's \$19.4M out for \$17.7M in, which works. But you're trading a versatile wing defender and a veteran rim-running center for half a season of bench scoring. Charlotte might be motivated to move him rather than lose him for nothing (and Houston might need to throw in a 2nd round pick anyway to entice the Hornets to make this trade), but Houston would be gutting rotation depth for a player who doesn't solve their primary ball-handling problem and might walk in July anyway.

![Collin Sexton Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766965368427.png)

**Malik Monk:** It might be over for Monk in Sacramento. Kings coach Doug Christie recently benched him against Portland, citing a "crowded guard rotation" and opted for Keon Ellis's defense instead. Monk [told The Sacramento Bee](https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article313941354.html) he was "1,000% confused" by the decision. Sacramento wants to give Ellis more minutes and avoid paying Monk's $19.5M salary when Ellis hits free agency this summer. Moving on gives both sides a fresh start.

This season, Monk's averaging 12.4 ppg and 2.3 apg in 22.8 mpg, down from 28+ minutes the previous two years. A quick glance shows a down year stats-wise, but Monk's talent hasn't gone anywhere. In [2023-24](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628370/by-position?Season=2023-24) and [2024-25](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628370/by-position?Season=2024-25), Monk averaged over 5 assists per game while allowing 44.5% shooting to opposing guards ([defensive ratings of 115.1 and 114.5 respectively](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1628370/by-position?Season=2023-24)). He's not an elite defender, but he's competent in team schemes. His shooting is the concern. Monk's career [35.3% from three](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4066262/malik-monk) is below league average, but he takes them at volume (5+ attempts per game). The shot-making ability is there even if the efficiency isn't elite.

For Houston, Monk would slide into the starting point guard spot next to Amen Thompson. He'd operate as a secondary playmaker behind Şengün, taking pressure off Amen to orchestrate an offense he's not ready to run. The fit is clean on paper. Monk can create his own shot, hit open threes at a passable rate, and won't get hunted defensively in the playoffs. That checks the boxes Houston needs.

</figure>
</div>

Monk makes [\$19.5M annually through 2028](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/23606/malik-monk). That's three more years, not a rental like Sexton. Matching salary means DFS (\$12.7M) plus Capela (\$6.7M) gets you to $19.4M out. You're trading a versatile wing defender and a veteran rim-runner for a point guard with shooting questions. Stone would need to sweeten the pot with draft capital (that 2026 Chicago second-rounder at minimum), and even then, Sacramento might want more. The advantage here is motivation. The Kings want out of Monk's deal. That gives Houston leverage. If Sacramento is actively shopping him rather than waiting for the perfect offer, Stone can negotiate from a position of strength. Monk's not perfect, but he's available. That counts for something.

### Tier 3: Pounding the Table - What the Rockets Should Be Doing

>Low cost, clear fits, addresses the need without creating new problems. Make these calls. Keep making them. If Stone isn't pursuing these aggressively, he's not doing his job.

**Keon Ellis:** Playing for the Kings shouldn't be held against anyone, but Keon Ellis doesn't jump off the page. Still, [look closer](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1631165?PerMode=PerGame). Ellis shoots [41.7% from three](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4702177/keon-ellis) on a sub-15% usage rate (60% TS% for his career) and maintains a 1.85 AST/TO ratio. At 6'4", he profiles as a solid defender, with defensive ratings from Sacramento's competitive years backing that up ([109 in 2023-24](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1631165/advanced?Season=2023-24), [113.2 in 2024-25](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1631165/advanced?Season=2024-25)). For Rockets fans, think souped-up Josh Okogie.

<figcaption>Defensive Highlights for Ellis</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Ellis solves half of Houston's problem. The shooting is real, the defense is there, and he doesn't need the ball in his hands to contribute. What he doesn't do? Handle the ball. Ellis isn't running pick-and-rolls or orchestrating an offense when Şengün sits. He's a spot-up threat who makes the right pass but doesn't create for others. That matters when Houston's offense gets stagnant in the halfcourt.

[Dan Woike reported](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6902319/2025/12/19/lakers-trade-rumors-deadline-needs/?source=user_shared_article) Sacramento wants a protected first-rounder for him. For a rental who averages under 10 ppg and only fixes the spacing problem? That's steep. Ellis makes the Rockets better. Whether he makes them better enough to justify the cost is another question entirely.

![Keon Ellis Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766965275659.png)

**Chris Paul:** The Point God himself. He's [39 years old, averaging 2.9 ppg and 3.3 apg in 14.2 minutes per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/101108) for the Clippers. He's not even playing right now after LA sent him home mid-retirement tour. None of that matters though. This is about what he can teach.

Both [Paul](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/la-clippers/cap) and [Ja'sean Tate are on veteran minimums](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/houston-rockets/yearly). Straight swap, simple as. The Clippers are pushing for the play-in and aren't interested in selling their bigger pieces (hence why James Harden is still there). Tate is 30, younger than most of LA's current roster, and brings defensive versatility. He's fallen out of Houston's rotation but could provide depth for a Clippers team that needs it. For the Rockets, it's low-risk, high-reward. CP3 mentors Reed Sheppard and Amen Thompson through the subtleties of running an offense that he mastered over 18 years.

![CP3 Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766965029542.png)

CP3 has done this before. He took OKC's young core to the playoffs before their current dominance. He did the same in Phoenix, then San Antonio. Put Paul in a locker room with young talent (SGA, Lu Dort, Wemby, Devin Booker), and they get better. Houston's problem isn't that Reed and Amen lack talent. It's that neither is a natural point guard. Reed is a combo guard learning to create for others. Amen is an athletic freak trying to run pick-and-rolls he's not ready for. A few months of CP3 breaking down film and walking through reads could accelerate their development by a year.

</div>

If CP3 has anything left for playoff minutes, great. If not, his value is in practice. The only question is whether another contender offers LA something better first, or whether the Clippers just buy him out and start a bidding war.

**Coby White:**  Since Josh Giddey's arrival as the Bulls' primary playmaker, White is a dead man walking in Chicago. That hasn't stopped him from putting up career numbers. Currently, he's averaging [21.4 ppg in 29.6 mpg on 59.2% TS%](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1629632), shooting a [career 36.7% from three](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4395651/coby-white) while dishing 4.9 assists over the past three seasons. At [6'4", 195 lbs with a 6'5" wingspan](https://x.com/DraftExpress/status/1128722751106240513?lang=en), he has the size to defend multiple positions. His 113.14 career defensive rating backs that up. He's not a defensive stopper, but he's not a liability either. That matters when you're trying to fit into Houston's scheme.

White makes sense for Houston in ways the other names on this list don't. He doesn't need the ball in his hands to be effective. Plug him in at point guard next to Amen Thompson, and suddenly everyone's doing what they do best. Şengün operates as the primary hub. White spaces the floor and makes the right read. Amen cuts, slashes, and defends without forcing playmaking duties he's not ready for. Durant scores, Jabari shoots. Clear roles, no overlap.

<div class="wide">

<figcaption>White in his bag: Talented Scorer who can operate as a secondary initiator</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

The 4.9 assists aren't a concern. Houston doesn't need White to orchestrate the offense. They need him to score, make simple passes, and not turn the ball over. That's his game. He's shooting 36.7% from three on volume and can create his own shot when the offense stagnates. Defensively, he's solid enough to not get hunted in the playoffs. For a team that already ranks [third in offense](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*15&dir=A&sort=OFF_RATING) and [eighth in defense](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?CF=MIN*GE*15&dir=A&sort=DEF_RATING), White is the incremental upgrade that doesn't require sacrificing identity.

White makes [\$12.88M annually through 2026](https://www.spotrac.com/nba/player/_/id/31564/coby-white), then hits free agency. Matching salary means Capela (\$6.7M) and a smaller contract, or find another combination that gets them over $12M out. Chicago gets role players and maybe the 2026 second-rounder via Chicago (ironic, no). It's not a haul, but for a team rebuilding around Giddey, moving White for assets beats losing him in free agency.

![Coby White Spotrac Trade]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/spotrac-nba-trade-machine-1766965502379.png)

This is the move Stone should make. White solves the immediate problem without mortgaging the future. He fits the timeline, the scheme, and the budget. Most importantly, he makes the Rockets better without making them worse anywhere else.

The point is, Houston can't sit pat. The Spurs have already won the [season series](https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs) against the Thunder. The Nuggets are heating up with Jokic at the helm ([29.8/12.1/11.0 on 60.9/44.0/85.1 shooting splits](https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3112335/nikola-jokic)). The Timberwolves have Mini-Mike, Ant, leading them to victories along with Julius Randle and a strong defense [anchored by Rudy Gobert](https://dunksandthrees.com/epm?m=def). Even the Thunder, with their momentary struggles, are still [26-5](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings). The Western Conference is shaping up to be a gauntlet, where staying still means staying behind. Any one of these players could elevate the Rockets as a contender.
