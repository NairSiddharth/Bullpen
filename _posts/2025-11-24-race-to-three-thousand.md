description: An in-depth analysis of Jose Altuve’s pursuit of 3,000 career hits, examining his recent performance, aging curve projections, potential lockout impacts, and historical precedent from Craig Biggio to assess whether reaching the milestone by the end of his current contract is realistic.

*Author's Note: All player statistics pulled from FanGraphs unless otherwise specifically stated*

3,000 hits. One of the most prestigious clubs in all of baseball, filled with a who's who of players that you would consider making a superteam out of in MLB The Show. With the rise of [three true outcomes](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/idioms/three-true-outcomes) baseball, it becomes harder than ever to maintain the pace needed to get into this group of players. Among the current crop of players, Jose Altuve is maybe the closest to that milestone, but his path is far from easy.

He may be disliked by non-Houston fans, but the crowning achievement of perhaps the greatest Astros career (to me, at least) would be joining the 3,000-hit club. At 35 years old, he currently sits at 2,388 career hits after the 2025 season. Under [contract through 2029](https://www.spotrac.com/mlb/player/_/id/8688/jose-altuve), he needs 612 more hits to join one of baseball's most exclusive clubs.

### Simple Math

Altuve needs roughly 153 hits per season to reach 3,000 by the end of his deal. Over the past six full seasons (excluding pandemic-shortened 2020), he's averaged 155 hits despite missing time in 2023 with a broken thumb, making the math seemingly straightforward. Based on a simple linear projection, the math says Altuve gets there.

### Reality Check

Baseball, of course, isn't that simple. All the skills in baseball have a physical peak, plateau for a short while, then begin to drop off. For example, [batting average typically depends on reaction time and bat speed](https://thedynastyguru.com/2019/02/27/aging-gracefully-approaching-aging-curves-and-advanced-stats-part-ii/), peaking around ages 26 to 27. Decline can be offset to some degree with improved experience. With Altuve's declining batting average in recent years (.265 in 2025 vs. .295 in 2024 vs. .303 career average), it raises legitimate concerns about sustaining his elite contact ability. Applying an [ageing curve](https://community.fangraphs.com/joint-model-of-the-war-aging-curve/) to Altuve's projections while accounting for his ironman status and the increased likelihood of rest days and minor injuries, we get the following.

*Figure 2: Projections based on the joint WAR aging model detailed in [FanGraphs - Joint Model of the WAR Aging Curve](https://community.fangraphs.com/joint-model-of-the-war-aging-curve/) and [DynastyGurus - Aging Gracefully Part I and Part II](https://thedynastyguru.com/2019/02/27/aging-gracefully-approaching-aging-curves-and-advanced-stats-part-ii/).*

These projections are no longer quite as rosy for Altuve. We can see even with him defying Father Time, his best projections through the end of his contract leave him about 80 hits short of the golden number. Unless Altuve rediscovers his peak contact ability or adjusts his approach, reaching 3,000 by 2029 looks increasingly unlikely.

That doesn't even begin to incorporate the [looming lockout](https://apnews.com/article/mlb-lockout-salary-cap-b2abf5a48833dac97d65dc92ce32d0bb) on the horizon after the 2026 season, which, if not handled in a timely fashion, would take games away from the 2027 regular season. Every missed game is one fewer opportunity, and as just discussed, with Altuve's skills declining, those opportunities grow increasingly valuable.

*Figure 3: Hit Projections based on the joint WAR ageing model detailed in [FanGraphs - Joint Model of the WAR Aging Curve](https://community.fangraphs.com/joint-model-of-the-war-aging-curve/) and [DynastyGurus - Aging Gracefully Part I and Part II](https://thedynastyguru.com/2019/02/27/aging-gracefully-approaching-aging-curves-and-advanced-stats-part-ii/), and applying various lockout scenarios for 2027.*

As the graph above shows, Altuve is already projected to run short of the vaunted club if he simply plays out his current contract with no lockout, and with one? The path goes from mathematical improbability to almost certain impossibility.

### The Biggio Blueprint

Fortunately for Altuve, the future isn't set by my spreadsheets, and we can look to historical precedent for an alternative path to the 3,000-hit club. Astros fans may remember another legend's pursuit of 3,000: Craig Biggio. From 2002 to 2007, he was at best a [league-average offensive player, and at worst below average](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/craig-biggio/549/stats?position=2B) for the Astros per [fWAR](https://library.fangraphs.com/war/differences-fwar-rwar/). Despite that, they gave him yearly extensions and played him because he was serviceable on the field, instrumental to the Astros, and was chasing history. Altuve has brought the Astros multiple championships, an MVP, and [countless clutch hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esxuHHHnA2M) (I've linked my favorite) over what will be more than two decades with the franchise. The organization extended Biggio to chase history, and they will likely do the same for Altuve if he wants to stick around for the chase. As shown in the projections below, even with a partial season lockout, there's a high likelihood Altuve reaches 3,000 hits if his contract is extended until he's forty-two.

Where does this all leave Altuve? Trying to defy the ageing curve to put his name in baseball's history books (again). He'll have an entire franchise and city with him for the ride.
