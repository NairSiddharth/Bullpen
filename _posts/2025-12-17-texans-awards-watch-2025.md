It's time to bang the drum for the Houston Texan's postseason award candidates. The Texans have rattled off six straight wins to pull within a game of the AFC South lead, and they're doing it with an offense that's hitting its stride and a defense that's been dominant all year. Multiple players deserve recognition when All-Pro and Pro Bowl votes are cast. Here's who makes the cut.

### All-Pro

All-Pro teams separate the great from the elite. Twenty-two players per team, chosen by position, representing the absolute best the NFL has to offer. Making one is a career achievement. Making multiple? That's a Hall of Fame trajectory. Houston has three players with legitimate cases, all of them instrumental to the league's most dominant defense.

#### Will Anderson Jr. (WAJ)

Fans complained about the Texans trading up to select WAJ with the 3rd in the 2023 NFL draft. They're not complaining anymore. He's taken a leap every year, from DROY as a rookie, to Pro Bowler the next year, and now putting up All Pro numbers. He's currently 9th in sacks (10.5) and is tied for second in pass rush win rate among edge rushers ([23%, per ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46138675/2025-nfl-win-rates-top-teams-players-rankings-pass-run-block)). He's on pace for [12-13 sacks, 4-5 forced fumbles, and 19-20 tackles for loss](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/A/AndeWi01.htm), all while posting a career-low missed tackle rate. Young pass rushers who dominate on elite defenses are catnip for All-Pro voters. DE is a loaded position, with players like Myles Garrett or his teammate Danielle Hunter as competition, but WAJ is doing enough to force his name into the conversation. **Prediction: All-Pro 1st Team**

#### Derek Stingley Jr.

Every year a new cornerback takes the crown as the NFL's best. In 2023, it was Sauce Gardner. In 2024, Patrick Surtain II. In 2025, it's Derek Stingley Jr.'s turn. He has 3 interceptions and 12 passes defended to go with a career low [42.4% completion percentage when targeted and just a 52.6 passing rating](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StinDe00.htm). When he's been targeted, bad things happen for opposing QBs, which is why he's been targeted only 59 times all season. That's locking down one side of the field. He's the key to Houston's zone-heavy defense, surrendering just [0.70 yards per route run against zone coverage](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/cb/yprr-allowed-vs-zone?season=2025&sortBy=currentSeason&sortOrder=ASC&qualifier=100), sixth-best in the NFL. With both Surtain and Sauce having missed games this season, his competition becomes Quinyon Mitchell and Trent McDuffie. Strong opponents, but with Houston's defense ranking among the league's best and Stingley's numbers, he's the frontrunner. **Prediction: All-Pro 1st Team**

#### Danielle Hunter

When the Texans signed Danielle Hunter, they effectively swapped pass rushers with the Vikings (Jonathan Greenard for Danielle Hunter). One year in, and Houston clearly won that deal. Hunter is the other half of the league's most fearsome edge duo alongside Will Anderson Jr., and he's actually leading the pair in sacks. He's fifth in sacks (12) and is [eleventh in pass rush win rate among edge rushers](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/46138675/2025-nfl-win-rates-top-teams-players-rankings-pass-run-block). He's on track [for 14-15 sacks and a career-high QB hits](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/H/HuntDa01.htm).

Some may say Hunter benefits from WAJ on the opposite side of him. But that's how elite rushing duos work, and WAJ equally benefits from Hunter's presence. What deserves credit is Hunter's production at 31 years old. He's been one of the NFL's most consistent pass rushers for a decade, yet has only made one official All-Pro team (2018 second team). With 111.5 career sacks, he's quietly in the Hall of Fame conversation, but his resume lacks the postseason hardware to match his production. A second-team selection this year would be both deserved and significant for his legacy. **Prediction: All-Pro 2nd Team**

### Pro Bowl

All-Pros get the glory, but Pro Bowls still matter. The alternate system dilutes it, yes, but being an initial selection for the Pro Bowl is a recognition of an elite season. The three All-Pro candidates are obvious Pro Bowl selections too. Four more Texans deserve recognition, and it's not just the dominant Texans defense showing off this time.

#### Kamari Lassiter

Lassiter forms the other half of Houston's lockdown cornerback duo with Stingley and as a result, he gets targeted far more often. He's risen to the task. Lassiter has a [career-high four interceptions (tied for fifth league-wide), allows an 80.0 passer rating, is on pace for 90+ tackles and holds receivers to a 57.8% completion rate](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/L/LassKa00.htm). He's become more of a ball hawk this season, but hasn't sacrificed fundamentals in doing so with a career low 6.1% missed tackle rate (5 total). Like Stingley, Lassiter is critical to Houston's zone-heavy scheme, giving up just 1 YPRR against zone coverage ([tied eighth in the NFL](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/cb/yprr-allowed-vs-zone?season=2025&sortBy=currentSeason&sortOrder=ASC&qualifier=100)). PFF has him rated at [76.1 (9th among 112 CBs)](http://www.pff.com/nfl/players/kamari-lassiter/146727) giving more credence to Lassiter's strong season. The only reason I don't have him as an All-Pro candidate is that frankly speaking, he'd have an All-Pro case in most years, but voters rarely reward two corners from the same team, especially with the depth of talent at the position league-wide. **Prediction: Pro Bowl, All-Pro 2nd Team (Longshot)**

#### Jalen Pitre

Pitre is a throwback. Your favorite safety's favorite safety. He's laying down hits that wouldn't look out of place on the old ESPN "Jacked Up" show.

That physicality is a huge part of what makes Houston's defense dominant. Pitre isn't just an enforcer, though. He allows just a [49.4 rating when targeted, has 64.4% completion percentage rate, and 4 interceptions (tied for fifth league-wide)](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/P/PitrJa00.htm). That's elite. PFF agrees, rating him [89.5 or 1st/98 safeties](https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/jalen-pitre/57737). The only reason he isn't in the All-Pro tier is he's only played 11 games this season, and on track for 14 total. Great player, just not enough games. **Prediction: Pro Bowl**

#### Nico Collins

Nico Collins is the latest in Houston's lineage of elite receivers, following Andre Johnson and DeAndre Hopkins. This is his third straight 1,000-yard season, and he's on pace for [1,200+ yards and 7-8 touchdowns](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/C/CollNi00.htm) despite missing a game and playing three without CJ Stroud. He's been the constant in an inconsistent offense. His 33.34 dominator rating ([fifth in the NFL](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/receiving/dominator-rating?season=2025&qualifier=100)) shows just how much of Houston's passing attack runs through him. He's not just a high-volume target, he's efficient as well, posting top-20 rates in drop percentage ([2.94%](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/receiving/drop-percentage?season=2025&sortBy=currentSeason&sortOrder=ASC)) and ultra-consistent [2.7 YPRR vs. Man](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/receiving/yprr-vs-man?season=2025&teamId=e9568e0f-5863-4c69-8763-33fadc679dc3&team=Houston%20Texans) and [2.4 YPRR vs. Zone](https://statrankings.com/nfl/advanced/players/receiving/yprr-vs-man?season=2025&teamId=e9568e0f-5863-4c69-8763-33fadc679dc3&team=Houston%20Texans). Maybe not flashy, but ranking [seventh in total yards, sixth in YPC, and fourteenth in TDs](https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/player/_/stat/receiving/table/receiving/sort/receivingTouchdowns/dir/desc) aren't accidents. The All-Pro class at receiver is loaded with names like Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Puka Nacua, Jamarr Chase, and Amon Ra, but Nico Collins deserves recognition of his own. **Prediction: Pro Bowl**

#### Ka'imi Fairbairn

To be accurate, it's John Christian Kaʻiminoeauloamekaʻikeokekumupaʻa Fairbairn. Mouthful, isn't it? Just call him one of the NFL's most consistent kickers. Fairbairn has been Houston's kicker for nine seasons, but this might be his finest. He ranks [second in field goal attempts and third in makes](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2025/kicking.htm) despite missing two games. He's hitting at a [10th-best clip league-wide](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2025/kicking.htm) with perfect accuracy on extra points and everything under 50 yards. From 50+, he's converted six of ten attempts. Those are Pro Bowl numbers. The challenge? All-Pro and Pro Bowl selections for kickers typically go hand in hand, and the missed games hurt his volume stats compared to Cameron Dicker (94.4% FG percentage) and Jason Myers (league leader in attempts and makes). Brandon Aubrey has been excellent but missed an extra point, while Fairbairn remains perfect. If voters reward efficiency over volume, Fairbairn has a case. If not, he's on the outside looking in. **Prediction: Pro Bowl (longshot)**
