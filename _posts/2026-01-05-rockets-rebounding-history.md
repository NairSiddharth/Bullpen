The modern NBA isn't the same as it used to be. Too much shooting, not enough defense. No fundamentals. Boo. Hiss. Well, the Houston Rockets are playing the game the way your dad wanted (with that modern twist). Crash the glass, control the pace, grind opponents into paste. Rinse, repeat. Houston ranks [first in offensive rebounds](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/traditional?dir=A&sort=OREB), and it's not close. We're talking [historically great](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/offensive-rebounds-per-game?date=2026-01-04). All without sacrificing scoring efficiency. There's a reason they're [fourth in the Western Conference](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings).

### Possessions are Everything

"He who controls the ball, controls the game" - Ime Udoka/Baron Harkonnen. Offensive rebounds are free possessions, and free possessions are stolen opportunities. Every extra rebound Houston has is one fewer chance the opponent has to score and one more to demoralize them.

Offensive rebounds stack up quickly, with every subsequent offensive rebound on a possession potentially dragging the clock another 14 seconds. There's a reason their pace of play is [96.96, 28th in the NBA](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&sort=PACE). Slow play and more offensive rebounds? That's one compounding effect. Add in Houston's scoring efficiency, [7th in the NBA (59.6% TS%)](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&sort=TS_PCT) and it's double compounded (compoundeded? A subject for a different day).

How much of an outlier is Houston? They're averaging [16.0 offensive rebounds per game](https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/stat/offensive-rebounds-per-game?date=2026-01-04), 1.7 ahead of second-place Portland and 4.5 above league average. That rate hasn't been matched since [2001-02](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2002.html), when the league played a completely different brand of basketball. Teams shot fewer threes, played slower, and crashed the glass by default. League average offensive rebounds that season was 12.2. Houston is posting throwback numbers in a league that actively discourages them.

Defensively, Houston slips from historically elite to merely good, ranking [8th in DREB%](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?dir=A&sort=DREB_PCT) this season. That's not a concern, though. It's a foundation. Houston can't win the possession battle on the offensive glass if they're giving the ball right back. They take care of their own glass, and then go hunt the opponents.

It all comes together to create a team that has the most rebounds per game (48.7) since the [1979-1980 NBA season](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980.html) (49.5 from the Washington Bullets), when there were only 22 teams and the 3-pointer was a polite suggestion.

### All-Time Rebounders off the Bench

The Rockets rebounding prowess starts with two all-timers off the bench. Steven Adams and Clint Capela are 8th (3.6) and 9th (3.6) [all-time](https://www.nba.com/stats/alltime-leaders?SeasonType=Regular+Season&PerMode=PerGame&StatCategory=OREB&ActiveFlag=No) in offensive rebounds per game, [3rd and 4th](https://www.nba.com/stats/alltime-leaders?SeasonType=Regular+Season&PerMode=PerGame&StatCategory=OREB&ActiveFlag=Yes) among active players. Most teams want one of them. The Rockets have two, and neither starts. Adams averages 21.7 minutes per game, starter-level run for a supposed backup. He spells Sengun in the rotation or joins him for double-big lineups that overwhelm opponents on the glass. Capela plays a smaller role at 11.6 minutes, but even limited run from a top-10 all-time offensive rebounder adds up. When the starters rest, the glass work doesn't stop.

The starters pull their own weight though. Alperen Şengün and Amen Thompson are rapidly becoming all-time offensive rebounders in their own right, ranking 45th ([2.9](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sengual01.html#site_menu_link)) and 79th ([2.6](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/t/thompam01.html)), 7th and 16th among active players. Şengün is 22. Thompson is 21. Neither needs to crash the glass to justify his spot. Şengün is Houston's offensive hub, a passing savant at center. Thompson is an elite perimeter defender and transition menace. They could leak out, cherry-pick, conserve energy. Instead, they hunt boards. Two years under Udoka, and crashing the glass is second nature. [Seven Rockets average at least one offensive rebound per game](https://www.nba.com/stats/team/1610612745/players-traditional?dir=D&sort=OREB). It's not a few guys carrying the load. Everyone crashes. All gas, no brakes.

*Note that Adams and Capela qualify for the all-time list due to playing [400 career games](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/statminimums), Şengün and Thompson have not. Places taken by looking at their career averages and placing them appropriately.*

### Board Men Get Rewarded

Rebounds turn into extra possessions. Extra possessions turn into assists, points, more rebounds. Everyone eats.

We see this in two distinct ways with the Rockets. First, the halfcourt offense with Şengün as the hub. He's averaging [22.6 points and 6.7 assists](https://www.nba.com/stats/player/1630578?dir=D&sort=USG_PCT), both career highs, while his usage rate (26.4%) is actually lower than his 2023-24 mark. The pace is 28th in the league. The math shouldn't work. But extra possessions from offensive rebounds mean more touches, more shots, more opportunities to create. Houston takes [66.5% of their shots as twos, highest in the NBA, converting at 53.9%](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/shots-general?dir=D&sort=FG2A_FREQUENCY). They're not kicking out for threes off offensive boards. They're going right back at the rim. Slow pace doesn't have to mean less opportunity. Here it means efficiency.

Then, the transition game. The Rockets haven't turned the clock back completely after all. That 8th ranking in DREB% turns into a [5th-ranked transition offense](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/transition?dir=D&sort=PERCENTILE). Thompson pushes the ball, drawing attention and creating advantages. He's not the one finishing. Şengün converts at the 77th percentile in transition, rare efficiency for a center in space. Off the bench, Tari Eason and Reed Sheppard sit at the 87th and 80th percentiles. The defensive rebound starts the sequence. Thompson runs. The [team guns](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/transition?CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*hou&dir=D&sort=POSS).

### Turning Hustle into Wins

It's all coming together for the Rockets. The net rating is [+7.5](https://dunksandthrees.com/ratings), second in the league behind only Oklahoma City. The offense ranks 5th, powered by extra possessions and Şengün's career year. The defense ranks 2nd, eliminating second chances and triggering transition. Rebounding fuels both ends.

Houston sits [fourth in the West](https://www.espn.com/nba/standings), but opportunity is knocking. Victor Wembanyama and Nikola Jokić are both sidelined with hyperextensions. The Spurs and Nuggets are vulnerable. A push into second place is there for the taking, and seeding matters. Finish second, and Houston avoids OKC until the Western Conference Finals. That's not a minor detail for a young team ([37-year-old](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/duranke01.html) KD excluded) still learning how to win in the playoffs.

The Rockets have something most young teams don't, an identity. When the game gets ugly, they know what to do. Crash the glass. Control possessions. Grind. It's not flashy. It won't make highlight reels. But it wins games, and it travels to the postseason.

Your dad would be proud.
