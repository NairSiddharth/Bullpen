I'm Sid, a lifelong Houstonian writing about baseball, football, and basketball topics in my city! Along the way, I'll try to use my coding background to augment these articles with simulations/graphs of different things I find interesting.

If you have a topic related to the Astros, Texans, or Rockets you want me to write about - [reach out via email](mailto:nair.sid01@gmail.com) and I'll see what I can do.
